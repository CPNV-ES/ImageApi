## Project Managment

### Version Control

This project uses [trunk-based development](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development) as a version control strategy.

This allows the development team to fully imbrace the CI/CD architecture, which insures the project works at all times. The fast iteration cycle brought by trunk-based development is also very suitable for the length and scope of this project.
